* This repository helps to set up my build enviroment
  
  The whole setup is based on [[https://github.com/pfultz2/cget][cget]]. You can install cget with =pip3 install cget=.

* Normal build enviroment

  Just copy this repository to =~/local= and set up environment variables in =.profile= as
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    export PATH=${HOME}/local/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    export CGET_PREFIX=${HOME}/local
  #+END_SRC
  Now you can easily install packages, e.g. to install the latest version of [[https://github.com/mosra/magnum][Magnum]] you just run =$ cget install magnum=.

* Emscripten build enviroment

  1. You should start by installing [[https://github.com/kripken/emscripten][Emscripten]] by following the install instructions therein. 

  2. Set up environmental variable =EMSCRIPTEN= to the Emscripten installation directory. For example by adding =export EMSCRIPTEN=some path/emsdk/emscripten/1.37.36= to your =.profile=

  3. Copy this repository to =${EMSCRIPTEN}/system=

  4. Initialize =cget= by calling =cget init --prefix ${EMSCRIPTEN}/system --toolchains ${EMSCRIPTEN}/system/etc/toolchains/generic/Emscripten-wasm.cmake=

  
  Now you should be able to start installing packages like: =cget --prefix ${EMSCRIPTEN}/system install magnum=.

  Or you should be able to build any cmake project by =cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${EMSCRIPTEN}/system/cget/cget.cmake=
