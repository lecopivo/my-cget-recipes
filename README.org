* This repository helps to set up my build enviroment
  
  The whole setup is based on [[https://github.com/pfultz2/cget][cget]]. You can install cget with =pip3 install cget=.

* Build environment setup

  First we have to pick a directory, I usually choose =~/local=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  mkdir -p ~/local; cd ~/local
  git init; git remote add origin git@github.com:lecopivo/my-cget-recipes.git; git pull origin master;
  #+END_SRC

  Now you can easily install packages, e.g. to install the latest version of [[https://github.com/mosra/magnum][Magnum]] you just run =$cget --prefix ~/local install magnum=.
  
** Optional: Set up environment variables
   You probably want to set up environmental variables such that install binaries and libraries can be found.

   Add this to your =~/.profile= (you probably want to relogin to take an effect)
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    export PATH=${HOME}/local/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    export CGET_PREFIX=${HOME}/local
   #+END_SRC

   Now you can install library just by calling =cget install magnum=

** Emscripten build environment
   
   You need [[https://github.com/kripken/emscripten][Emscripten]] installed and environment variable =EMSCRIPTEN= has to be set to the directory where =em++= is e.g. =export EMSCIRPTEN=some path/emsdk/emscripten/1.37.36/=.

   Now we pick a directory where to set up our environment, I usually choose =~/wasm-local/=. Then you run

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     mkdir -p ~/wasm-local; cd ~/wasm-local
     git init; git remote add origin git@github.com:lecopivo/my-cget-recipes.git; git pull origin master;
     cget init --prefix . --toolchain ./etc/toolchains/generic/Emscripten-wasm.cmake
   #+END_SRC

     Now you can easily install packages, e.g. to install the latest version of [[https://github.com/mosra/magnum][Magnum]] you just run =$cget --prefix ~/wasm-local install magnum=.

* Package Installation

  NOTE: All the following examples are for environment =~/wasm-local/=, change
  the directory to the appropriate directory.
  
  To install package:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cget --prefix ~/wasm-local install magnum
  #+END_SRC

* Building project with in an environment

  NOTE: All the following examples are for environment =~/wasm-local/=, change
  the directory to the appropriate directory.

  To run cmake for specific build environment just supply appropriate
  toolchain file
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/wasm-local/cget/cget.cmake
  #+END_SRC

  Or in the directory where =CMakeLists.txt= exists run 
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     ~/wasm-local/bin/configure-build 
  #+END_SRC
